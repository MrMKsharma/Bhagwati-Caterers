## Task 2: Fix Menu Items and Images Not Loading

### Issues Identified:
1. Menu items existed in the database but had no images (null values)
2. Image directories were empty except for a placeholder
3. The menu page was showing "No items found" because of the loading state

### Solutions Implemented:
1. Created a script to update menu items with appropriate image URLs
2. Added sample image files to the public directory:
   - `/images/menu/appetizers/samosa.jpg`
   - `/images/menu/main/paneer-makhani.jpg`
   - `/images/menu/main/dal-tadka.jpg`
   - `/images/menu/desserts/gulab-jamun.jpg`
3. Updated the database to link menu items with these images
4. Verified that the API now returns proper image URLs

### Files Created:
1. `scripts/check-menu-items.ts` - Script to check menu items in database
2. `scripts/test-menu-api.ts` - Script to test menu API response
3. `scripts/update-menu-images.ts` - Script to update menu items with images

### Verification:
- Menu items now display with images
- API returns proper image URLs
- Application loads menu items correctly
- Development server is running without errors

## Summary
Both tasks have been successfully completed:
1. All instances of "वनस्पती" have been changed to "शाकाहारी" across the application
2. Menu items and images are now loading properly with sample images added to the public directory and database updated accordingly

The application is now running on http://localhost:3001 with all the requested changes implemented.
