# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature addresses critical deployment failures preventing successful builds on Render hosting platform. The application was experiencing TypeScript compilation errors, ESLint violations, and build process failures that blocked production deployments. The solution systematically resolves these issues while maintaining code quality and functionality.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Build Process Success

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the application to build successfully without errors, so that I can deploy it to production hosting platforms.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the build command is executed THEN the system SHALL complete without TypeScript compilation errors
2. WHEN the build process runs THEN the system SHALL generate all static pages successfully
3. WHEN linting is performed THEN the system SHALL pass all ESLint checks without errors
4. WHEN the build is deployed THEN the system SHALL be accessible and functional on the hosting platform

### Requirement 2: Code Quality Standards

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the codebase to follow consistent quality standards, so that it remains maintainable and follows best practices.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN TypeScript compilation occurs THEN the system SHALL have no `any` types in the codebase
2. WHEN code analysis is performed THEN the system SHALL have proper type definitions for all functions and components
3. WHEN imports are analyzed THEN the system SHALL have no unused imports or variables
4. WHEN the code is reviewed THEN the system SHALL follow ES6 module syntax consistently

### Requirement 3: React and Accessibility Compliance

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the React components to follow best practices and accessibility standards, so that the application is robust and inclusive.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN JSX is rendered THEN the system SHALL have properly escaped entities and no unescaped characters
2. WHEN images are displayed THEN the system SHALL have appropriate alt attributes for accessibility
3. WHEN React hooks are used THEN the system SHALL have proper dependency arrays and no missing dependencies
4. WHEN Next.js features are used THEN the system SHALL use optimized Image components instead of basic img tags

### Requirement 4: Service Worker Functionality

**User Story:** As a user, I want the application to work offline and cache resources properly, so that I have a reliable experience even with poor connectivity.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the service worker installs THEN the system SHALL cache essential resources without failing on missing files
2. WHEN network requests fail THEN the system SHALL serve cached content gracefully
3. WHEN the service worker updates THEN the system SHALL handle version changes without breaking functionality
4. WHEN offline functionality is needed THEN the system SHALL provide appropriate fallback responses
